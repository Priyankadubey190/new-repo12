                <p>Birds (Aves) are a group of vertebrates which evolved from dinosaurs. They are endothermic, with feathers. Modern birds are toothless: they have beaked jaws. They lay hard-shelled eggs. They have a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.
                Birds live all over the world. They range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.70 m (9 ft) ostrich. They are the class of tetrapods with the most living species: about ten thousand. More than half of these are passerines, sometimes known as perching birds.
                Birds are the closest living relatives of the Crocodilia. The fossil record shows that birds evolved from feathered theropod dinosaurs.
